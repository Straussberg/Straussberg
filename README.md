## 👋 Hi, I’m Jean Lauro Müller

**Research Scientist & Developer** with 37+ years of experience at the intersection of computer science and physics. Based at the Fourier Digital Institute  (FDI), I specialize in:

- **Computational Physics & Simulation**  
  - Advanced particle dynamics in magnetic and nano-atomic fields  
  - Cryogenic fluid flow modeling via non-linear fourth-order hydrodynamics  
  - 3D visualization of Van Allen belt radiation with spacecraft dose calculations  
  - Black hole interaction trajectories and gravitational merge animations  
  - Hodgkin–Huxley–type reactor power estimates and Chernobyl AI-driven risk analysis

- **Scientific Computing & Data Visualization**  
  - High-performance Python implementations (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)  
  - Real-time adaptive checkpointing algorithms  
  - Pluto orbital animations (1 year = 1 s, 248 s total)  
  - Astroid curve generation and Traveling Salesman Problem simulations  
  - Erdős–Kac theorem statistical experiments and cumulative distribution plotting

- **Quantum Information & Algorithms**  
  - Simulation of 64-qubit quantum circuits  
  - Exploration of Størmer’s theory in large-dimensional operator algebras  
  - Concepts for “Black Holes as Super Quantum Computers”

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies
